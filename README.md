# bmi_calculator

A Body Mass Index Calculator Flutter application.

## Getting Started

Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

## Flutter Widgets Used

- use Flutter themes to create coherent branding.
- create multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button.
- pass functions as parameters and fields.
- use the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- use custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
